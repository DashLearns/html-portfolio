<h3>"Enter The Dragon"</h3>
<p>
  This is arguably Bruce Lees's greatest film. Not only are the fight scenes
  amazing, if you look hard enough, you can see Bruce fighting a young Jackie
  Chan and a young Sammo Hung! Epic.

<h3>Aliens</h3>
<p>
  What's more badass than an alien movie? Sigorney Weaver fighting an alien
  queen in a cargo mech suit.

<h3>Coming To America</h3>
<p>
  Eddie Murphy has a litany of funny films. This one is special because of how
  timeless it is. A phenomal cast (RIP James Earl Jones). CTA is insanely funny,
  but it's comedy with class.
