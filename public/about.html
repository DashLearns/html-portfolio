<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a Georga-born, American expat living in Japan. After having been here for
  17 years now, I'm trying to figure out how I want to spend the rest of my
  adult life. Is it time to go back home? Is it time to buy a house here? Who
  knows where the future holds, but I can't go wrong if I keep trying to improve
  myself. I'll start by working on something I've always wanted to do, build
  things from scratch. That's why I started coding in the first place.
